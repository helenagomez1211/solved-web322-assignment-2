<h1>Features</h1>

<h1>Responsive Design</h1>




Ensure that your entire website renders well on a variety of devices, specifically on desktops, tablets, and smartphones. To accomplish this, you will need to use Bootstrap in your project.




<h1>Server-Side Validation</h1>




<ul>

 <li>You are required to implement Server-Side validation for both the login and registration form. <strong><u>NO HTML5 VALIDATION OR CLIENT-SIDE JS VALIDATION IS ALLOWED</u></strong></li>

 <li>For the login form, you are required to ONLY check for nulls (i.e. check to see if the user entered a value in the respective text fields). However, for the registration form, you have to check for nulls AND implement at least 2 complex validation criteria using regular expressions on two separate fields(For example, enforcing that the user must enter a password that is 6 to 12 characters and the password must have letters and numbers only) .</li>

 <li>Your form should not clear the data entered in the form if there are validation errors.</li>

 <li>All error messages must be rendered on their respective pages or areas and must be styled properly, like Figure 1.1</li>

</ul>




<strong>Figure 1.1</strong>




<h2>User Registration Form (Sending Emails)</h2>




When a user fills out the registration form and then hits the submit button, provided that all the validation criteria were not violated, your website must then <strong>send a welcome email message to the user’s email address and then redirect the user to a dashboard page.</strong> For now, the dashboard page should contain information welcoming the user and should be properly styled.







<h2>Git, GitHub and Heroku</h2>




Your web application must be pushed to a remote GitHub or Bitbucket repository on your account. Please note that <strong>you must set your remote repository to private</strong> and then add me as a collaborator so I can view your web application. Lastly, you are required to deploy the working web application to Heroku.
